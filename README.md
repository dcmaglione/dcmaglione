Hello! I'm a rising Sophomore at Boston University pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science with a concentration in systems and development. In CS, my passions are software development, IT operations, GNU/Linux, and open-source software. 

When I'm not programming, you'll find me spending time with friends, reading a good book, or enjoying a nice cup of coffee (sometimes tea).
