## About Me ##
I'm a Software Engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab working on Intelligent Combat Platforms.

When I'm not clacking away at a keyboard, you'll find me spending quality time with friends and family, skateboarding around the city, reading a good book, or enjoying a nice cup of coffee.
