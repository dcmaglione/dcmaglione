I'm a rising Sophomore at Boston University pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science with a concentration in 
systems and development. In CS, my passions are software development, IT operations, GNU/Linux, and 
open-source software. Below is a little more about me, and what I'm up to!

* üü¶ Seeking an internship for Summer '22 and currently aspiring to be a Product Manager or DevOps Engineer.
* ‚¨õÔ∏è Planning to complete a dual minor in Economics and Innovation & Entrepreneurship at BU.
* ‚¨úÔ∏è Serving as the current Director of Recruitment for BU Upsilon Pi Epsilon ([UPE](https://upe.bu.edu/)).

When I'm not programming, you'll find me spending time with friends, skateboarding around the city, reading 
a good book, or enjoying a nice cup of coffee (sometimes tea).
