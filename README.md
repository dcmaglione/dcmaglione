# Dominic Maglione #

## Hello! 👋
I'm a rising Sophomore at Boston University pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science with a concentration in systems and development. In CS, my passions are software development, IT operations, GNU/Linux, and open-source software. Below is a little more about me, and what I'm up to!

* 🟦 Seeking an internship for Summer '22 and currently aspiring to be a Cloud Engineer or UNIX System Administrator.
* ⬛️ Planning to complete a prospective minor in Economics at BU.
* ⬜️ Serving as the current Director of Recruitment for BU Upsilon Pi Epsilon ([UPE](https://upe.bu.edu/)).

When I'm not programming, you'll find me spending time with friends, skateboarding around the city, reading a good book, or enjoying a nice cup of coffee (sometimes tea ☕️).
