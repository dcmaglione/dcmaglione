Hello! I'm a rising Sophomore at Boston University pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science with a concentration in systems and development. Currently, I am planning to an accelerated Master's in Computer Science here at BU. In CS, my passions are software development, IT operations, GNU/Linux, and open-source software. I am currently aspiring to be a Cloud Engineer or UNIX System Administrator and seeking an internship for Summer '22.

When I'm not programming, you'll find me spending time with friends, skateboarding around the city, reading a good book, or enjoying a nice cup of coffee (sometimes tea). 

Feel free to check out my website!
